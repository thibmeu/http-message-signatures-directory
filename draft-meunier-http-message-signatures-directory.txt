         draft-meunier-http-message-signatures-directory-latest

Abstract

   This document describes a method for clients using
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES] to advertise their signing keys.

   It defines a key directory format based on JWKS as defined in
   Section 5 of [JWK], as well as new HTTP Method Context to allow for
   in-band key discovery.

1.  Introduction

   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES] allow a signer to generate a signature over
   an HTTP message, and a verifier to validate it.  The specification
   assumes verifiers have prior knowledge of signers' key material,
   requiring out-of-band key distribution mechanisms.  This creates
   deployment friction and limits the ability to dynamically verify
   signatures from previously unknown signers.

   This document defines: 1.  A standardized key directory format based
   on JWKS for publishing HTTP Message Signatures keys 2.  A well-known
   URI location for discovering these key directories 3.  A new HTTP
   header field enabling in-band key directory location discovery

   Together, these mechanisms enable key distribution and discovery for
   HTTP Message Signatures cryptographic material.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Configuration

   The key directory is served as a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) as defined
   in Section 5 of [JWK].  The "alg" parameter are restricted to
   algorithm registered against HTTP Signature Algorithms Section of
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES-IANA]

   The directory SHOULD be server over HTTPS.  The directory MUST be
   served with media type application/http-message-signatures-directory.

   Client application SHOULD validate the directory format and reject
   malformed entries.

4.  HTTP Method Context Signature-Agent

   A service sending signed requests as defined in
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES] MAY include a Signature-Agent header field
   to communicate its signing key directory.  This header field contains
   a URI allowing retrieval of an HTTP Message Signatures Directory as
   defined in Section 3.

4.1.  Header Field Definition

   The Signature-Agent header field is an Item Structured Header
   [STRUCTURED-HEADERS].  Its value MUST be a String containing a [URI].
   The ABNF is:

 Signature-Agent = sf-string   ; Section 3.3.3 of {{STRUCTURED-HEADERS}}

   The URI scheme MUST be one of: - *https (RECOMMENDED)*: Points to an
   HTTPS resource serving the key directory - *http*: Points to an HTTP
   resource serving the key directory - *data*: Contains an inline key
   directory

   When using the "data" URI scheme, the media type MUST be application/
   http-message-signatures-directory.  The content MAY be base64 encoded
   as per [BASE64].

   Multiple Signature-Agent header fields MAY be present in a request.
   Processors SHOULD use the first valid URI that provides a valid key
   directory.

   TODO: for inlining, CBOR Keys could be useful

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Key rotation

   Clients SHOULD implement key rotation by including multiple keys in
   the directory with different validity period.  When rotating keys,
   clients SHOULD:

   1.  Add the new key to the directory before its intended use date

   2.  Continue to include the old key until its expiration date

   3.  Remove expired keys from the directory

   Servers SHOULD cache the directory contents and refresh upon
   expiration.

6.  Privacy Considerations

   Key directories enable discovery of signing keys which may reveal
   information about the signing entity.  Implementers should consider:

6.1.  Directory Content

   Key directories should only contain keys actively used for signing.
   Including additional keys or metadata may expose unnecessary
   information about the signing service.

6.2.  Access Patterns

   Verifiers accessing key directories may reveal information about
   signature verification patterns.  Directory servers should avoid
   logging personally identifiable information from directory requests.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains considerations for IANA.

7.1.  Well-Known 'http-message-signatures-directory' URI

   This document updates the "Well-Known URIs" Registry [WellKnownURIs]
   with the following values.

   +===============+============+===========+===========+=============+
   | URI Suffix    | Change     | Reference | Status    | Related     |
   |               | Controller |           |           | information |
   +===============+============+===========+===========+=============+
   | http-message- | IETF       | [this     | permanent | None        |

   | directory     |            |           |           |             |
   +---------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+
