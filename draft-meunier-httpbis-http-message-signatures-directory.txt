                   HTTP Message Signatures Directory
     draft-meunier-httpbis-http-message-signatures-directory-latest

Abstract

   This document describe a method for clients using using
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES] to advertise their signing keys.

   It defines a key directory format based on JWKS as defined in
   Section 5 of [JWK], as well as new HTTP Method Context to allow for
   in-band key discovery.

1.  Introduction

   TODO Introduction

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Configuration

   The key directory is served as a JSON Web Key Set (JWKS) as defined
   in Section 5 of [JWK].  The "alg" parameter are restricted to
   algorithm registered against HTTP Signature Algorithms Section of
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES-IANA]

   The directory SHOULD be server over HTTPS.  The directory MUST be
   served with media type application/http-message-signatures-directory.

   Client application SHOULD validate the directory format and reject
   malformed entries.

4.  HTTP Method Context Signature-Agent

   A service sending signed request as defined in
   [HTTP-MESSAGE-SIGNATURES] MAY provide HTTP Method Context Signature-
   Agent.  This header is defined as a URI to a directory.

   The URI scheme SHOULD be one of:

   1.  http

   2.  https

   3.  data

   http/https point to the origin component serving an HTTP Message
   Signatures as defined in Section 3. data MUST have media type
   application/http-message-signatures-directory, and MAY be base64
   encoded. ( CBOR would be very useful here)

   This extends the set of headers defined in [RFC9110].

   Signature-Agent

   Signature-Agent = [[ URI ]]

5.  Security Considerations

5.1.  Key rotation

      TODO: reference key directory over http draft

   Clients SHOULD implement key rotation by including multiple keys in
   the directory with different validity period.  When rotating keys,
   clients SHOULD:

   1.  Add the new key to the directory before its intended use date

   2.  Continue to include the old key until its expiration date

   3.  Remove expired keys from the directory

   Servers SHOULD cache the directory contents and refresh upon
   expiration.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This section contains considerations for IANA.

6.1.  Well-Known 'http-message-signatures-directory' URI

   This document updates the "Well-Known URIs" Registry [WellKnownURIs]
   with the following values.

   +===============+============+===========+===========+=============+
   | URI Suffix    | Change     | Reference | Status    | Related     |
   |               | Controller |           |           | information |
   +===============+============+===========+===========+=============+
   | http-message- | IETF       | [this     | permanent | None        |
   | signatures-   |            | document] |           |             |
   | directory     |            |           |           |             |
   +---------------+------------+-----------+-----------+-------------+
