1.  Introduction

   Bots are increasigly using Signature-Agent as a way to convey
   identity.  As such, there is interest from Origins to define robot
   policy based on this header.

   This documents extends Robot Exclusion Protocol to support these, by
   defining a new group starting with signature-agent.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Specification

3.1.  Protocol Definition

   Group  One or more signature-agent lines that are followed by one or
      more rules.  The group is terminated by a signature-agent line or
      end of file.  See Section 3.2.1.  The last group may have no
      rules, which means it implicitly allows everything.

3.2.  Formal Syntax

   Based on the formal syntax defined in Section 2.2 of [RFC9309]

startgroupline = user-agent-line / signature-agent-line ; a group can either be a user-agent, a signature-agent, or both.

user-agent-line = *WS "user-agent" *WS ":" *WS product-token EOL
signature-agent-line = *WS "signature-agent" *WS ":" *WS directory-token EOL

directory-token = fqdn

fqdn = ... ; domain as defined by signature-agent

3.2.1.  Signature-Agent line

   Crawlers set their own identity, which is called a directory-agent,
   to find relevant groups.  The directory token MUST contain only
   lowercase letters ("a-z"), underscores ("_"), hyphens ("-"), and dots
   (".").  The directory token SHOULD be a valid FQDN suffix of the
   identification string that the crawler sends to the service.  For
   example, in the case of HTTP [RFC9110], the product token SHOULD be a
   substring in the Signature-Agent header.  The identification string
   SHOULD describe the public cryptographic key material of the crawler.
   Here's an example of a Signature-Agent HTTP request header with a
   link pointing to a page describing the purpose of the
   crawler.example.com crawler, which appears as a suffix in the
   Signature-Agent HTTP header and as a directory token in the
   robots.txt directory-agent line

+==========================================+==============================+
| Signature-Agent HTTP header              | robots.txt signature-agent   |
|                                          | line                         |
+==========================================+==============================+
| Signature-Agent: crawler.example.com     | signature-agent: example.com |
+------------------------------------------+------------------------------+

4.  Security Considerations

   Signature-Agent group shares the security consideration of [RFC9309].
   In addition, given Signature-Agent MAY present a domain name
   identifying crawlers public cryptographic key material, implementors
   should treat the content of signature-agent line as possibly
   sensitive.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
