--- abstract

This document describes a new directive to allow Signature-Agent ({{Section 4 of SIGNATURE-DIRECTORY}}) directive in the Robot Exclusion Protocol ({{RFC9309}}).

# Introduction

Bots are increasigly using Signature-Agent as a way to convey identity.
As such, there is interest from Origins to define robot policy based on this header.

This documents extends Robot Exclusion Protocol to support these, by defining a new group starting with signature-agent.


# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

# Specification

## Protocol Definition

Group
: One or more signature-agent lines that are followed by one or more rules. The group is terminated by a signature-agent line or end of file. See {{signature-agent-line}}. The last group may have no rules, which means it implicitly allows everything.

## Formal Syntax

Based on the formal syntax defined in {{Section 2.2 of RFC9309}}

~~~
startgroupline = user-agent-line / signature-agent-line ; a group can either be a user-agent, a signature-agent, or both.

user-agent-line = *WS "user-agent" *WS ":" *WS product-token EOL
signature-agent-line = *WS "signature-agent" *WS ":" *WS directory-token EOL

directory-token = fqdn

fqdn = ... ; domain as defined by signature-agent
~~~

### Signature-Agent line

Crawlers set their own identity, which is called a directory-agent, to find relevant groups.
The directory token MUST contain only lowercase letters ("a-z"), underscores ("_"), hyphens ("-"), and dots (".").
The directory token SHOULD be a valid FQDN suffix of the identification string that the crawler sends to the service.
For example, in the case of HTTP {{RFC9110}}, the product token SHOULD be a substring in the Signature-Agent header.
The identification string SHOULD describe the public cryptographic key material of the crawler.
Here's an example of a Signature-Agent HTTP request header with a link pointing to a page describing the purpose of the crawler.example.com crawler, which appears as a suffix in the Signature-Agent HTTP header and as a directory token in the robots.txt directory-agent line

~~~
+==========================================+==============================+
| Signature-Agent HTTP header              | robots.txt signature-agent   |
|                                          | line                         |
+==========================================+==============================+
| Signature-Agent: crawler.example.com     | signature-agent: example.com |

# Security Considerations {#security}

Signature-Agent group shares the security consideration of {{RFC9309}}. In addition, given Signature-Agent MAY present
a domain name identifying crawlers public cryptographic key material, implementors should treat the content of signature-agent
line as possibly sensitive.


# IANA Considerations

This document has no IANA actions.

## Signature-Agent with raw keyid

Not in the draft yet. We don't want to incentivise not rotating public keys.
